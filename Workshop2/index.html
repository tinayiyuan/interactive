  <p>
  Coughing at night can be annoying for your bed mate, and keep you up at night. Some nighttime coughs can be a sign of other respiratory issues like a cold, bronchitis, whooping cough, pneumonia, congestive heart failure, asthma, or GERD. If your cough doesn’t improve at night after a week or so, see your doctor. Most nighttime coughs are a symptom of allergies or congested airways, and can get better with the right remedy.

    <h4>1: Sleep on an incline.</h4> Prop yourself on pillows before you go to sleep and try to sleep on more than one pillow. This will prevent all the postnasal drainage and mucus you swallow during the day from backing up in your throat when you lay down at night.[1]

    <li>You can also place wooden blocks under the head of your bed to raise it by 4 inches. This angle will help to keep acids down in your stomach so they won’t irritate your throat.</li>>
    <li>If possible, avoid sleeping on your back as this can put strain on your breathing at night and cause you to cough.[2]</li>>
    <li>Sleeping on an incline with increased number of pillow is the best way to cure a cough from congestive heart failure (CHF) at night. The water collects in the lower lung fields and does not affect breathing.</li>>
    </ul>
