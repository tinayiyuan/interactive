A Boat<br>

O beautiful<br>

was the werewolf<br>

in his evil forest.<br>

We took him<br>

to the carnival<br>

and he started<br>

crying<br>

when he saw<br>

the Ferris wheel.<br>

Electric<br>

green and red tears<br>

flowed down<br>

his furry cheeks.<br>

He looked<br>

like a boat<br>

out on the dark<br>

water.<br>



â€” Richard Brautigan<br>
