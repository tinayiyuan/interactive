A &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBoat <br>

O &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspbeautiful<br>

was &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe werewolf<br>

in his &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspevil forest.<br>

We took &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphim<br>

to the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcarnival<br>

<p>and he &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspstarted</p>

crying<br>

when he saw&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe Ferris wheel.<br>

Electric green and red tears<br>

flowed down<br>

his furry cheeks.<br>

He looked<br>

like a boat<br>

out on the dark<br>

water.<br>



â€” Richard Brautigan<br>
