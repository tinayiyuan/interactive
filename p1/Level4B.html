A Boat

O beautiful

was the werewolf<br>

in his evil forest.<br>

We took him<br>

to the carnival<br>
and he started

crying

when he saw<br>

the Ferris wheel.<br>

Electric

green and red tears<br>

flowed down

his furry cheeks.<br>

He looked

like a boat<br>

out on the dark<br>

water.



— Richard Brautigan<br>
